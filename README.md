(0) Intro
Hej everyone,
I am available for projects.

I have a few basic requirements:

✅ Remote only
✅ Part-time (60-80%) or OnDemand
✅ German | English

And offer the following:

(1) Product Management
I come from a project management, digitization and entrepreneurial background. Today, I only offer remote work. But, all of my prior experience pays into my work.
- Wordpress & Web  ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
  - I have worked with Wordpress for +10 years and am fluent with Low/No-Code tools. Depending on the level of digitization of the project/client, I would recommend a Headless CMS and something like Gatsby instead of WP.
- Mobile ⭐️⭐️
  - I am currently in the process of preparing for a personal React Native (mobile) project
- Others  ⭐️⭐️⭐️
  - I implement & work with GA, GTM, Hotjar, etc …
  - I am used any modern technology & collaboration tech stack

(2) Design
I have been designing for around 10 years, but I used to hire designers for detailed & larger works. At the beginning of the pandemic, I was a) hit by the bottleneck for remote talents and 
b) quickly thereafter I discovered Figma, and then I chose to advance my very own skills. You can find an excerpt of my latest work on my Figma profile ⬇️.

- UI/UX ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
  - I have mostly worked on web projects until very recently. Currently, I am working on a design for a mobile productivity app for factory workers.
  - Like many, I happily take inspiration from existing projects and remix them into unique UI’s that respect or advance existing CI’s. Just to indicate some depth to this statement, I prefer Dribbble for inspiration instead of Behance. 
  - Generally, I believe in shipping the solution, rather than too artsy & perfect designs. I am always amazed how average (compared to high-end designs) successful products look.
  - I regularly seek, study & apply design/UI kits & templates
- Wireframing ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
  - I started to wireframe +10 years ago with a tool called Balsamiq
  - today I use Figjam or Miro
- Graphic ⭐️⭐️
  -  I tend to buy icons/illustrations.

(3) Programming
I started my programming journey during the pandemic and did not settle/specialize yet. Ergo, the highest rating I give to myself is 4 stars. In general, it looks like I will specialize in React, React Native and Python. Programming is currently the highest priority for me because 🤩.

- Html & CSS ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
  - I really enjoy CSS and am very comfortable with flexbox, grid and playing with any methodology, or anything new, from BEM to Tailwind. Why not 5 stars? There was no need yet to achieve 5 stars and JS is/was just too intriguing.
- Java Script ⭐️⭐️
  - I already applied JS to web projects and watched & hacked hours of tutorials. By now, I have an advanced understanding up to OOP level. I will now build up   
  practical experience, either through side-projects or client-work.
- React/React Native ⭐️
  - I have the fundamental understanding and studied multiple of the many documentations in the ecosystem. I am ready to praxis aka. coding my first UIs.
