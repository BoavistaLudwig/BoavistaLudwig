(0) Intro
Hej everyone,
I am available for projects.

I have a few basic requirements:

✅ Remote only
✅ German | English
✅ Topics: Industrial, Mobile, Manufacturing, Productivity, Health

And offer the following:

(1) Product Management
I come from a project management, startup and manufacturing background. Today, I only offer remote work.
- Wordpress & Web  ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
  - I have worked with Wordpress for +10 years and am fluent with Low/No-Code tools and their limitations. Depending on the level of digitization of the project/client, I don’t recommend WP.
- Mobile ⭐️⭐️
  - I am currently in the process of managing a personal React Native (mobile) project. This includes intense studies.
- Staff/Team  ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
  - I hired and collaborated with remote talents for +10 years, mainly via Upwork.com
  - I hired and collaborated with agencies in Krakow, Poznan & Warsaw, Poland
- Others  ⭐️⭐️⭐️
  - I implement & work with GA, GTM, Hotjar, etc …
  - I am used to any modern technology & collaboration tech stack

(2) Design
I have been designing for around 10 years, but I used to hire designers for detailed & larger works. At the beginning of the pandemic, I was a) hit by the bottleneck for remote talents and 
b) quickly thereafter I discovered Figma, and then I chose to advance my very own skills. You can find an excerpt of my latest work on my Figma profile ⬇️.

- UI/UX ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
  - I have mostly worked on web projects until very recently. Currently, I am working on a design for a mobile productivity app for factory workers. This includes advanced studies of design methodologies, UI libraries & mobile frameworks but also real-world interviews.
  - Like many, I happily take inspiration from existing projects and remix them into unique UI’s that respect or advance existing CI’s. Just to indicate some depth to this statement, I prefer Dribbble for inspiration instead of Behance. 
  - Generally, I believe in shipping the solution, rather than too artsy & perfect designs. I am always amazed how average (compared to high-end design works) successful products look. I prefer success with the user.
- Wireframing ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
  - I started to wireframe +10 years ago with a tool called Balsamiq. Today I use Figjam or Miro. 
  - I happily engage/hire others to create multiple sets.
- Graphic ⭐️⭐️
  -  I tend to buy icons & illustrations.

(3) Programming
I started my programming journey during the pandemic and did not settle/specialize yet. In general, it looks like I will specialize in React, React Native and Python. Programming is currently the highest priority for me because 🤩.

- Html & CSS ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
  - I really enjoy vanilla CSS and am very comfortable with any advanced methodologies/extensions or frameworks: from Sass, to BEM to Tailwind.  
- Java Script ⭐️⭐️
  - I already applied JS to web projects and watched + hacked hours of tutorials. By now, I have an advanced understanding of vanilla JA up to OOP/TDD level. I will now build up   
  practical experience, either through side-projects or client-work.
- React/React Native ⭐️
  - I have the fundamental understanding and studied multiple of the many documentations in the ecosystem. I am ready to praxis aka. coding my first UIs.
