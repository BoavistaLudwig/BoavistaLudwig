      (0) Intro
      Hej,
      I am available for projects right now.

      Basic requirements:

      ✅ Remote only
      ✅ Part-time or OnDemand
      ✅ German | English

      (1) Product Management
      I come from a project management, venture building and entrepreneurial background. Today, I only offer digital remote work. But, all of that
      prior experience pays into my digital work.
      - Wordpress & Web  ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
        - I work with Wordpress for +10 years and am fluent with Low/No-Code tools.
      - Mobile ⭐️⭐️
        - I am currently in the process of preparing for a personal React Native (mobile) project
      - Technical marketing ⭐️⭐️⭐️
        - I implement & work with GA, GTM, Hotjar, etc ...

      (2) Design
      I design for ages, but I used to hire designers for detailed work. At the beginning of the pandemic, I was a) hit by the bottleneck for talents and 
      b) quickly thereafter I discovered Figma, and choose to advance my very own skills. You can find an excerpt of my work on my Figma profile.

      - UI/UX ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
        - Mostly web. I am currently working on a concept for a mobile web.
        - Like many, I happily take inspiration from existing projects and remix them.
        - I regularly seek & study design/UI kits & templates
      - Wireframing ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
        - I started to wireframe +10 years ago with a tool called Balsamiq
        - today I use Figjam or Miro
      - Graphic ⭐️⭐️
        -  I tend to buy icons/illustrations.

      (3) Programming
      I started my programming journey during the pandemic and did not settle/specialise yet. Ergo, the highest rating I give to myself are 4 stars. In 
      general, it looks like I will specialise on React/React Native and Python. Programming has currently the highest priority for me.

      - Html & CSS ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
        - I really enjoy CSS and am very comfortable with flexbox, grid and playing with any methology or anything new, from BEM to Tailwind. Why not 5 
        stars? There was no need yet to achieve 5 stars and JS is/was just too intriguing.
      - Java Script ⭐️⭐️⭐️
        - I already applied JS to web projects. Watched hours of tutorials. By now I have an advanced understanding up to OOP level. I will now build up   
        practical experience, either through side-projects or client-work.
      - React/React Native ⭐️
        - Fundamental understanding. Studied multiple of the many documentations in the ecosystem. Ready to praxis aka. hacking-level. I already found the 
        tutor that I will study in parallel.
