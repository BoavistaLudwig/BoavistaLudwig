      Hej,
      I am {available now} for projects and would like to partake ...

      ✅ Remote only
      ✅ Part-time (negotiable) or OnDemand (Daily rate €600)
      ✅ German | English

      (1) Product Management

      - Wordpress  ☆☆☆☆
      - Management ☆☆☆
        - Remote talents
        - Onsite, Poland
      - Technical marketing ☆☆☆
        - GA, GTM, Hotjar
      - I come from project management, venture developing and entrepreneurship. Today, I only offer remote work. But that experience pays into my
      execution.


      (2) Design
      I design for ages, but I used to hire designers for detailed work. At the beginning of the pandemic, I was a) hit by the bottleneck for talents and 
      b) quickly thereafter discovered Figma, and choose to advance my very own skills.

      - UI ☆☆☆☆
        - Mostly web. I am currently working on a concept for a mobile web.
        - Like many, I happily take inspirations from existing projects and remix them.
        - I regularly study design/UI kits & templates
      - UX ☆☆☆☆
        - I apply common sense
        - I prefer lean designs
        - I find it facinating that many of the most successful products have rather average-level designs
      - Wireframing ☆☆☆☆☆
        - started many years ago with a tool called Balsmiq
        - today I use Figjam or Miro
      - Graphic ☆☆
        -  I tend to buy icons/illustrations.


      (3) Programming
      I started my journey into programming during the pandemic and did not settle/specialise yet. Ergo, the highest rating I give myself are 4 stars. In 
      general, it looks like I will specialise on React/React Native and Python. Programming has currently the highest priority for me.

      - Html ☆☆☆☆
        - I am very comfortable with HTML. Why not 5 stars? There was just no need yet to achieve 5 stars.
      - CSS ☆☆☆☆
        - I really enjoy CSS and am very comfortable with flexbox, grid and playing with any methology or anything new, from BEM to Tailwind. Why not 5 
        stars? There was no need yet to achieve 5 stars and JS is/was just too intriguing.
      - Java Script ☆☆☆
        - I already applied JS to web projects. Watched (follow) hours of tutorials. Advanced understanding to OOP level. I now will build up practical 
        experience, either through side-projects or client-work.
      - React/React Native ☆
        - Fundamental understanding. Studied multiple of the many documentations in the ecosystem. Ready to praxis aka. hacking-level.
